This is an app that I've created using the Yelp API and Google Maps API. This app will allow you to search for
anything such as Restaurants, Car Washes, Movie Theaters, etc.

**Note:** You can leave the search term empty, but the location must be filled out. Location accepts city, zipcode
or state.
